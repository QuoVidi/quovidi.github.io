## Principle of the game

The principle of the game is to collect **bounties** in your natural environment, based on a list of **quests** defined by the game masters. The quests can be whatever the game masters choose it to be: biological structures, street art or architectural curiosities. Once you have found one of the quest, tak a picture of it, then submit it through the QuoVidi interface. It will be corrected by the game masters. 

Throughtout the game, you will be in competition with the other teams. Indeed, the more correct bounties you collect, the more points you will have 

You can try the game as **player** by using the [test interface here](https://plantmodelling.shinyapps.io/biogo_test/). You need to use `sacha` as a username and `pikachu` for the password.
